# Project-5-Drinks-Delivery

My second object-oriented console project.\
Now organized by folders, Enums, Interface, Models, Repositories, UI.\
A app with multiple menus, login/register menu, followed by a client menu where you can see\
the products registred in the admin menu (the admin menu can be acessed to by typing email: admin, password admin)\
in the drinks menu there's a option to see the drinks, add to the cart, remove from the cart, see the subtotal\
and finish your order.
